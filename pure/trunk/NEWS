** Pure 0.3 2008-06-06

This release sports a lot of improvements as well as bug and portability
fixes, see the ChangeLog for details. The build system has gone through a
major overhaul, adding autoconf support. 64 bit support has been improved, and
Pure now also works on MS Windows. Moreover, many library functions have been
rewritten to make them tail-recursive, and some new functions have been added.
Last but not least, the runtime support is now implemented as a separate
shared library which makes it possible to link external modules against the
runtime, and reduces the memory footprint when multiple instances of the
interpreter are run as different processes.

Special thanks to Tim Haynes, John Lunney, Eddie Rucker, Ryan Schmidt, Libor
Spacek and Jiri Spitz for contributions, suggestions and bug reports.

** Pure 0.2 2008-05-04

On the heels of Pure 0.1 comes the first bugfix release which addresses a
couple of bugs, misfeatures and Mac OSX compatibility issues, please refer to
the ChangeLog for details. I also added a more detailed INSTALL guide (thanks
are due to Eddie Rucker who wrote most of the new material in this guide) and
updated the manpage with a few minor corrections and some remarks about issues
raised on the Pure mailing list.

Please note that there are still some issues with Pure on 64 bit systems (as
well as on Ubuntu running on PowerPC) which are still on my TODO list, these
will hopefully be fixed in the next release.

Thanks to all who sent in bug reports and patches, in particular: Chris
Double, Tim Haynes, Eddie Rucker, Ryan Schmidt and Libor Spacek. (I hope I
didn't forget anyone.)

** Pure 0.1 2008-04-29

The much-awaited initial release. ;-) The interpreter is already fully
functional, but of course there's still a lot to be done (see the TODO file
for details). Please note that this is a preliminary, "beta" release, so
expect some bugs (and please report them to the author!).

The Pure project is now hosted at SourceForge, see http://pure-lang.sf.net. A
mailing list should soon be available, too.

See the INSTALLATION section in the README file to get up and running quickly.
After Pure is installed, read the Pure manual page (also available in various
formats from the Pure website) and have a look at the stuff in the examples
subdir, especially hello.pure, and review the standard library modules
(lib/*.pure).

Enjoy!
