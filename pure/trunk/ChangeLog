2008-08-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): Add signal constants.

	* pure.cc (main): Set up handlers for standard POSIX termination
	signals, mapping these to orderly Pure exceptions of the form
	'signal SIG'.

	* interpreter.cc (builtin_codegen), runtime.cc(bigint_div,
	bigint_mod): Handle division by zero by throwing a 'signal SIGFPE'
	exception. Previously, these would just bail out with an unhandled
	SIGFPE signal.

	* lexer.ll: Fixed a bug in option parsing of the 'list' command
	which would cause an option string starting with '-a' to be
	interpreted as an ordinary argument.

	* runtime.cc (pure_catch, pure_sys_vars): Fixed memory leaks.

2008-08-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_catch): Fix wrong stack cleanup, causing
	segfaults with catch/throw. Reported by Libor Spacek.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Additional configury for proper
	handling of dynamic linking on OSX (-install_name option,
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH). Reported by Ryan Schmidt. NOTE: This change
	requires a reconfigure.

2008-08-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (doeval, dodefn): Optimize the case of toplevel
	evaluations and variable definitions of constant expressions.

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Fixed memory leak caused by the new
	list and tuple code. Reported by Jiri Spitz. We now also impose a
	minimum size for speeding up the generated code for smaller list
	and tuple sizes.

2008-08-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Overhaul environment-handling code in the code
	generator so that it properly handles nested 'with' environments.

2008-07-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* w3centities.c: Updated to latest from W3C.

2008-07-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (codegen): Streamline code for list and tuple
	expressions. This works around some severe performance bugs in the
	LLVM JIT, which gets awfully slow on deep call graphs.

	* interpreter.cc (run): LLVM 2.3 requires that we add the default
	shared library extension manually.

2008-07-11  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc/h: Apply Rooslan S. Khayrov's patches to make the
	interpreter compile with LLVM 2.3.

	Note that this means that Pure really needs LLVM 2.3 now. By
	reverting these changes you can still make it work with LLVM 2.2,
	but we really recommend using LLVM 2.3 now since it has many
	improvements and bugfixes.

2008-07-08  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/math.pure: Add random number generator
	(Mersenne twister). Suggested by Jiri Spitz.

	* examples/avltree.pure: Added to examples.

	* lib/math.pure: Moved abs, sgn, min, max, pred and succ from
	math.pure to primitives.pure, so that they are included in the
	prelude. Make x%0 behave like x div 0 (which raises SIGFPE).

	* lib/: Jiri Spitz' port of the Q container types were added to
	the library (array.pure, dict.pure, heap.pure, set.pure).

2008-07-07  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/strings.pure: Make slicing work with strings.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fixed a bug in init function. Reported by
	Libor Spacek.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/system.pure: Added strftime function.

	* printer.cc: Add missing parens around low-precedence elements in
	proper lists. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

2008-07-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Added new "mapsto" constructor. Requested by
	Jiri Spitz.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): Turn system constants into real
	constant definitions.

	* runtime.cc/h, lib/system.pure: Added a few time functions to the
	system interface.

2008-07-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (run): Temporarily suppress verbose output for
	using clause. This also makes the some of the test logs much
	smaller. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

2008-07-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/math.pure: Added rational numbers.

2008-07-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure, runtime.cc/h: Add the GMP gcd and lcm
	functions.

	* lexer.ll: 'list' command now also prints fixity and nullary
	declarations of listed symbols.

	* lib/math.pure: Added various bits and pieces, most notably the
	complex numbers. Also moved sqrt function from primitives.pure to
	math.pure.

2008-06-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Fix a segfault in external
	wrapper routines, due to the shadow stack not being popped when
	an external fails and thus the default rule gets used.

2008-06-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure.xml: Improved syntax highlighting for Kate. Fixed up
	highlighting of quoted string chars, as suggested by Eddie Rucker.
	Also added folding support for comments and block structure
	(case/with/when ... end).

	* lib/math.pure: Started module with math operations (exp, ln,
	trigonometric functions, etc.).

2008-06-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Promote type tags and substitute constants on
	the rhs of variable and constant definitions.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Using xs!ns for slicing conflicts with more
	general indexing of containers with arbitrary keys. Use !! for
	slicing instead. Restrict the definition to lists and tuples, and
	simplify it by using a list comprehension. Suggested by Jiri
	Spitz.

2008-06-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc/h: Added pure_current_interp(), variable and constant
	definitions, management of temporary definition levels.

	* pure.cc, interpreter.cc, lexer.ll: Fix up completion support,
	second attempt (constructor symbols without any rules were
	still missing).

2008-06-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Fix up list command to properly deal with the new
	constant symbol category. -c now lists constant symbols, the
	previous -c option (print matching automata) was renamed to -a.

	* interpreter.cc et al: Implement constant definitions, as
	discussed on the mailing list. These work like variable
	definitions (using the new 'def' keyword in lieu of 'let'), but
	constants cannot be redefined (unless you first clear an existing
	definition), and constant values are directly substituted into the
	right-hand sides of equations rather than being evaluated at
	runtime.

2008-06-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/sort.c: Add another example for the runtime API.
	This one shows how to implement a C function in a module to be
	loaded by the Pure interpreter, which in turn calls other C and
	Pure functions.

2008-06-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac: Bump version number.

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Bugfix: include external symbols in command
	completion.

	* examples/poor.c: Add an example for the new public runtime API.
	Shows how to interface to the Pure interpreter in a standalone C
	application.

	* interpreter.cc/h, runtime.cc/h, lib/strings.pure: Add error
	reporting to the eval() routine.

	* interpreter.cc: Bugfix to make recursive source file parses work
	inside eval().

	* runtime.h, runtime.cc: Refactored the runtime library to provide
	a semantically complete public API for module writers.

	These operations are meant to be used by client modules or
	standalone applications which need to create their own Pure
	interpreters and/or require direct access to Pure expression
	data. See the PUBLIC API section in runtime.h for details. Modules
	created with this API must be linked against the runtime library
	(libpure.so).

2008-06-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.h, runtime.cc: Make pure_invoke() callable from C.

2008-06-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* expr.cc, interpreter.cc, parser.yy, lexer.ll, printer.cc:
	Implement Haskell-style "as" patterns. Also make sure that '_' on
	the lhs is always treated as the anonymous variable, even if it
	occurs as the head symbol in a function application.

2008-06-21  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure-mode.el.in, etc/pure.vim, etc/pure.xml, etc/pure.lang:
	Cosmetic changes, all modes now highlight catch/throw.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Fixed a glitch in the definition of foldr1
	which caused list elements to be processed in the wrong order.

2008-06-20  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.4 release.

	* pure.cc, lexer.ll: Fake interactive mode when we're not
	connected to a terminal but -i is specified. Thus sign-on message
	and command prompts will be printed as usual. This is needed, in
	particular, to make Emacs Pure-Eval mode work on Windows.

2008-06-19  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/symbolic.pure: Fix DNF example to accommodate changes
	in the operator system.

	* interpreter.cc (declare): Fix segfault in reporting of
	conflicting fixity declarations.

2008-06-18  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Add hash function to compute 32
	bit hash codes of Pure expressions. Suggested by Jiri Spitz.

	* parser.yy, lexer.ll, interpreter.hh/cc: Add syntax for multiple
	left-hand sides in function definitions and 'case' rules, as
	requested by Jiri Spitz and discussed on the mailing list. See the
	manual page for details.

	* symtable.cc, lib/prelude.pure, lib/primitives.pure: Rename the
	bitwise operators '&' and '|' to 'and' and 'or'.

2008-06-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* etc/pure.lang: New language definition file for Andre Simon's
	highlight program (http:/www.andre-simon.de/). This allows you to
	format Pure sources with syntax highlighting as HTML and LaTeX
	files, for instance.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Clean up the source tree. Moved
	auxiliary configure files and the syntax highlighting and
	programming mode stuff into separate config and etc
	subdirectories. Moreover, Makefile.in now has a target to
	regenerate the configury using autoconf and autoheader.

2008-06-15  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* matcher.hh: gcc 4.3 compatibility fixes. Suggested by Toni
	Graffy.

2008-06-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll: Various changes in order to facilitate script
	execution and interfacing to Emacs.

	Initial '#!' on a line now denotes a comment line, in order to
	support shebangs (see below).

	The new 'completion_matches' command provides information about
	completions to programs driving the interpreter, such as Emacs
	(see below).

	Paging of the 'list' command is now implemented using the program
	specified with the PURE_MORE environment variable. This allows you
	to disable this option (if PURE_MORE is undefined) or choose any
	pager program and options that you prefer. Define PURE_MORE=more
	in your shell startup files to get back the old behaviour of
	piping 'list' output through 'more'.

	* pure.cc: Added new -q (quiet) and -x (execute) options. The
	former is used in pure-mode.el to suppress the sign-on message of
	the interpreter. The latter can be used in conjunction with the
	new #! comment syntax to add shebangs to your script, see the
	manpage for details.

	* pure-mode.el.in: Added new Emacs Pure mode. This is a quick and
	dirty hack of Q mode and still needs some work (in particular,
	auto indentation is pretty much broken right now).

2008-06-13  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in, etc.: Overhauled configury and bumped
	the version number.

	Building a separate runtime lib on x86-64 works now (but requires
	a patched LLVM, see the INSTALL file for details). Linking the
	runtime lib on OSX should also work now. Moreover, it is now
	possible to install different Pure versions in parallel, again see
	the INSTALL file for details.

2008-06-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.3 release.

	* configure.ac, etc.: Added autoconf support. Various fixes for 64
	bit and Windows compatibility. See the INSTALL file for updated
	installation instructions.

2008-06-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile, interpreter.cc: Put the runtime and interpreter into a
	separate shared library, to make it possible for modules to link
	against the runtime, and to reduce the memory footprint when
	multiple instances of the interpreter are run as different
	processes. Also, this makes it possible to access the runtime
	routines on systems where a program cannot dlopen itself.

2008-05-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Optimization of pure_freenew calls.

	* lib/strings.pure: Make 'cycle' work on strings. Reported by
	Eddie Rucker.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Make 'index' work on lists. Code contributed
	by Eddie Rucker.

2008-05-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Rewrite prelude operations to make them
	tail-recursive.

	* interpreter.cc (toplevel_codegen): Experimental support for
	tail-recursive logical operators (&& and ||). This works but is
	disabled, since it makes these operations behave in different ways
	depending on the context, which is a really bad idea because it
	violates referential transparency.

2008-05-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Overhaul of the shadow stack
	machinery. Environment vectors are now maintained on the shadow
	stack, so that all local functions and anonymous closures are
	eligible for tail call optimization, even if they need access to
	their environment.

2008-05-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Add marshalling between long (64
	bit) ints and Pure bigints in the C interface. This means that
	both Pure ints and bigints can now be passed for 'long' arguments
	of externals (with sign extension/truncation as necessary), and
	'long' values are promoted to Pure bigints on return. Hence C
	functions taking 64 bit integers as arguments and returning them
	as results can now be called from Pure without loosing bits due to
	truncation.

	* interpreter.cc: Make toplevel if-then-else properly
	tail-recursive. Thus, e.g., the following function will now run in
	constant stack space: count x = if x<=0 then x else count (x-1);
	This also works with nested if-then-else constructs, as long as
	they form the right-hand side of an equation.

2008-05-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Fix more memory allocation bugs in
	exception handling.

	* runtime.cc, lib/system.pure: Bugfixes in the scanf
	functions. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

	* pure.cc, runtime.cc, util.cc: Windows/MinGW compatibility
	fixes. Suggested by Jiri Spitz.

2008-05-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Fix premature freeing of eval result, and a minor
	memory allocation glitch in the catch function. Reported by Eddie
	Rucker.

	* Makefile: Bump version number.

	* interpreter.cc: If there are any child environments, doeval and
	dodefn both create semi-permanent environments now, so that the
	child environments and the corresponding LLVM IR survive for the
	entire lifetime of any embedded closures, which might still be
	called at a later time. This fixes the segfaults occurring when a
	closure gets called after its associated environment was purged. A
	partial fix for some situations (as reported earlier by Chris
	Double) was already in the 0.2 release, but this didn't deal with
	all cases, such as closures constructed in a call to the eval
	function, as reported by Eddie Rucker.

2008-05-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Major overhaul of expression memory
	handling. Fixed the shadow stack and memory debugging code. Both
	function arguments and environment are now visible on the shadow
	stack, and all remaining memory leaks have been fixed. Note that,
	compared to previous revisions, the shadow stack slows down
	compiled code by some 10% and it needs some additional memory.
	OTOH, it also provides additional data that will be needed in the
	planned symbolic debugger, and it seems to be the most efficient
	way to handle dangling expression pointers after an exception
	anyway.

2008-05-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_free_internal): Fixed a glitch which was
	causing big memleaks. Reported by Libor Spacek.

	* interpreter.cc (define): Fixed error messages.
	
	* interpreter.cc, runtime.h: Reorganize pure_expr data structure
	so that the data fields are *always* aligned on 8 byte boundaries.
	This should now also work on 32 bit architectures where doubles
	are aligned on 8 byte boundaries, such as Linux on 32 bit PPC.
	Reported by Tim Haynes.

	* interpreter.cc: Fixed some case labels in switch instructions
	which should be signed rather than unsigned values. Also made
	void* a pointer to a dummy struct in LLVM IR, so that it can be
	distinguished from all other pointer types, and added support for
	short (16 bit) and long (64 bit) integer types (as well as the
	corresponding pointer types) in the C interface.

	Please note that the typename 'long' *always* denotes signed 64
	bit integers in Pure's extern declarations, even if the C 'long'
	type is actually 32 bit (as it usually is even on most 64 bit
	systems).

2008-05-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.h: Fix compilation problems when header gets included
	from C.

2008-05-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* funcall.h: Reduce maximum number of function parameters to
	64. This seems to be large enough for most purposes, and speeds up
	compilation with -Ox by a factor of around 10.

	* Makefile: Overhaul of build options. In particular, the
	'default' build now includes basic optimization (-O) which makes
	the interpreter almost as fast as with the 'release' build, and
	produces a working interpreter also on 64 bit systems. (The
	'debug' build is still broken there, but see the SYSTEM NOTES
	section in the INSTALL file for a workaround.)

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: 64 bit compatibility fixes in bigint
	handling.

2008-05-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Fix a severe bug in the environment handling
	code of the code generator, which could cause failed assertions in
	the code generator, or wrong code to be generated in some cases.
	To resolve this issue, the code generator now properly keeps
	separate environments for each rule of a function
	definition. Reported by John Lunney.

	* Makefile: Redirect warning and error messages from regression
	tests to the logfile.

2008-05-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (uminop): Handle the value -0x80000000 at the
	border of the int range, so that it is correctly treated as a
	machine int.

2008-05-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, printer.cc, etc.: Change the "G" suffix to denote
	bigints to "L" ("G" can too easily be mistaken for a digit; also,
	Python uses the same "L" notation for bigints). Reported by Eddie
	Rucker.

2008-05-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Made the pow function work with all
	combinations of integer and double arguments. Also added the sqrt
	function and the ^ operator.

	* runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Added predicates funp, lambdap,
	varp checking for named and anonymous closures and unbound global
	variables, respectively. Requested by Libor Spacek.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern, fun_prolog): Handle some obscure
	cases of name collisions between Pure and C functions.

2008-05-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* INSTALL: Add system-specific notes.

	* Makefile: Massaged some rules for OSX compatibility. In
	particular, -rdynamic is now in the LDFLAGS, so that it can be
	removed more easily, and I also removed the install -s flag so
	that the pure executable is installed without stripping the
	symbols which are needed to properly resolve runtime externals on
	OSX. Reported by Ryan Schmidt and others.

	* matcher.cc (merge_ctrans): Fixed broken mpz_cmp() test causing
	transitions on different (instead of equal) bigint constants to be
	merged. Reported by Libor Spacek.

2008-05-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.2 release.

	* lexer.ll, printer.cc: Add an explicit notation for big
	integers. Any integer immediately followed by the uppercase letter
	"G" (as in "biG" or "GMP") will now always be interpreted as a
	bigint constant, even if it fits into a machine integer. This
	notation is also used when printing bigint constants. This change
	was necessary to make it possible to write rules matching against
	"small bigint" constants.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added operations to recognize function
	applications and extract the function and argument parts,
	implemented in runtime.cc. Note that these operations can't be
	defined in Pure because of the "head is function" rule which means
	that in a pattern of the form f x, f is always a literal function
	symbol and not a variable.

2008-05-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* README: Moved installation instructions to a separate INSTALL
	file, added Eddie Rucker's detailed instructions there.

	* util.cc (myiconv): Apple's iconv takes const char** as 2nd
	parameter. #ifdef that case. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Fixed a bug in the generated
	wrapper code for external calls, which caused function arguments
	to be garbage-collected prematurely, when they were still needed
	to create the default value, in the case of external calls
	returning a null expression pointer to indicate failure. Reported
	by Eddie Rucker.

	* test/test4.pure: Disabled tail call checks, as they may fail on
	some platforms. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* test/test1.pure: Corrected fact3 example, added test cases.
	Reported by Libor Spacek.

2008-05-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile: Overhaul of regression tests so that results of
	expressions are recorded. Also, 'make check' doesn't depend on the
	log files any more, so that the logs can be stored in svn. You can
	now use the explicit goal 'make logs' to regenerate the logs for
	changed test files.

	* runtime.cc (same): Added a syntactic equality test. Requested by
	Eddie Rucker.

	* Makefile: Add $(LDFLAGS) and $(LIBS) to the link line, so that
	the user can easily add his own linker options and local
	libraries.

	* lib/strings.pure: Add missing range check in string indexing
	operation. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

	* printer.cc (operator <<): Handle stack overflow while printing
	an expression.

	* interpreter.cc (dodefn): Fix a tricky bug causing the executable
	code of closures bound to variables to be freed when it was still
	needed. Reported by Chris Double.

2008-05-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Proper alignment of value fields in expression
	struct on 64 bit systems. Reported by Tim Haynes.

	* Makefile: g++ shouldn't be hardcoded, use $(CXX) instead.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): More OSX compatibility fixes.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

2008-04-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Fix a compilation error (STL bug:
	http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11729) as well as some
	bogus warnings with Apple gcc 4.0.1. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* Makefile (make depend): Get rid of bogus LLVM dependencies.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* lexer.ll, parser.yy: Fixes for compatibility with newer flex and
	bison versions. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2008-04-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.1 release.

2008-04-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/symbolic.pure: Add symbolic evaluation example. This is
	just a straightforward port of some Q examples.

	* runtime.cc: Add support for advisory stack checks.

	* matcher.cc: Bugfixes.

2008-04-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/string.pure: Added split and join functions.

	* pure.1, examples/hello.pure: Overhaul n queens example, added
	quicksort and binary search tree examples.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Added void and curry/uncurry combinators, do,
	zipdo.

	* interpreter.cc, pure.cc, runtime.cc: Make SIGINT generate a
	useful exception value.

	* pure.cc: Add completion for global function and variable
	symbols.

2008-04-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Got a working interpreter, at last. There's still lots of stuff
	to do (see the TODO file), but the interpreter should now be
	usable as it is.

2008-03-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* ChangeLog started
