	* Makefile (pure.o): Add missing dependency of pure.o on Makefile,
	so that the main module gets recompiled when bumping the version
	number.

	* 0.2 release.

	* lexer.ll, printer.cc: Add an explicit notation for big
	integers. Any integer immediately followed by the uppercase letter
	"G" (as in "biG" or "GMP") will now always be interpreted as a
	bigint constant, even if it fits into a machine integer. This
	notation is also used when printing bigint constants. This change
	was necessary to make it possible to write rules matching against
	"small bigint" constants.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added operations to recognize function
	applications and extract the function and argument parts,
	implemented in runtime.cc. Note that these operations can't be
	defined in Pure because of the "head is function" rule which means
	that in a pattern of the form f x, f is always a literal function
	symbol and not a variable.

	* README: Moved installation instructions to a separate INSTALL
	file, added Eddie Rucker's detailed instructions there.

	* util.cc (myiconv): Apple's iconv takes const char** as 2nd
	parameter. #ifdef that case. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Fixed a bug in the generated
	wrapper code for external calls, which caused function arguments
	to be garbage-collected prematurely, when they were still needed
	to create the default value, in the case of external calls
	returning a null expression pointer to indicate failure. Reported
	by Eddie Rucker.

	* test/test4.pure: Disabled tail call checks, as they may fail on
	some platforms. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* test/test1.pure: Corrected fact3 example, added test cases.
	Reported by Libor Spacek.

2008-05-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile: Overhaul of regression tests so that results of
	expressions are recorded. Also, 'make check' doesn't depend on the
	log files any more, so that the logs can be stored in svn. You can
	now use the explicit goal 'make logs' to regenerate the logs for
	changed test files.

	* runtime.cc (same): Added a syntactic equality test. Requested by
	Eddie Rucker.

	* Makefile: Add $(LDFLAGS) and $(LIBS) to the link line, so that
	the user can easily add his own linker options and local
	libraries.

	* lib/strings.pure: Add missing range check in string indexing
	operation. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

	* printer.cc (operator <<): Handle stack overflow while printing
	an expression.

	* interpreter.cc (dodefn): Fix a tricky bug causing the executable
	code of closures bound to variables to be freed when it was still
	needed. Reported by Chris Double.

2008-05-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Proper alignment of value fields in expression
	struct on 64 bit systems. Reported by Tim Haynes.

	* Makefile: g++ shouldn't be hardcoded, use $(CXX) instead.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): More OSX compatibility fixes.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

2008-04-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Fix a compilation error (STL bug:
	http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11729) as well as some
	bogus warnings with Apple gcc 4.0.1. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* Makefile (make depend): Get rid of bogus LLVM dependencies.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* lexer.ll, parser.yy: Fixes for compatibility with newer flex and
	bison versions. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2008-04-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.1 release.

2008-04-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/symbolic.pure: Add symbolic evaluation example. This is
	just a straightforward port of some Q examples.

	* runtime.cc: Add support for advisory stack checks.

	* matcher.cc: Bugfixes.

2008-04-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/string.pure: Added split and join functions.

	* pure.1, examples/hello.pure: Overhaul n queens example, added
	quicksort and binary search tree examples.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Added void and curry/uncurry combinators, do,
	zipdo.

	* interpreter.cc, pure.cc, runtime.cc: Make SIGINT generate a
	useful exception value.

	* pure.cc: Add completion for global function and variable
	symbols.

2008-04-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Got a working interpreter, at last. There's still lots of stuff
	to do (see the TODO file), but the interpreter should now be
	usable as it is.

2008-03-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* ChangeLog started
