2008-05-26  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Overhaul of the shadow stack
	machinery. Environment vectors are now maintained on the shadow
	stack, so that all local functions and anonymous closures are
	eligible for tail call optimization, even if they need access to
	their environment.

2008-05-25  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/prelude.pure: Rewrite prelude operations to make them
	tail-recursive.

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Add marshalling between long (64
	bit) ints and Pure bigints in the C interface. This means that
	both Pure ints and bigints can now be passed for 'long' arguments
	of externals (with sign extension/truncation as necessary), and
	'long' values are promoted to Pure bigints on return. Hence C
	functions taking 64 bit integers as arguments and returning them
	as results can now be called from Pure without loosing bits due to
	truncation.

	* interpreter.cc: Make toplevel if-then-else properly
	tail-recursive. Thus, e.g., the following function will now run in
	constant stack space: count x = if x<=0 then x else count (x-1);
	This also works with nested if-then-else constructs, as long as
	they form the right-hand side of an equation.

2008-05-24  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Fix more memory allocation bugs in
	exception handling.

	* runtime.cc, lib/system.pure: Bugfixes in the scanf
	functions. Reported by Jiri Spitz.

	* pure.cc, runtime.cc, util.cc: Windows/MinGW compatibility
	fixes. Suggested by Jiri Spitz.

2008-05-23  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc: Fix premature freeing of eval result, and a minor
	memory allocation glitch in the catch function. Reported by Eddie
	Rucker.

	* Makefile: Bump version number.

	* interpreter.cc: If there are any child environments, doeval and
	dodefn both create semi-permanent environments now, so that the
	child environments and the corresponding LLVM IR survive for the
	entire lifetime of any embedded closures, which might still be
	called at a later time. This fixes the segfaults occurring when a
	closure gets called after its associated environment was purged. A
	partial fix for some situations (as reported earlier by Chris
	Double) was already in the 0.2 release, but this didn't deal with
	all cases, such as closures constructed in a call to the eval
	function, as reported by Eddie Rucker.

2008-05-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: Major overhaul of expression memory
	handling. Fixed the shadow stack and memory debugging code. Both
	function arguments and environment are now visible on the shadow
	stack, and all remaining memory leaks have been fixed. Note that,
	compared to previous revisions, the shadow stack slows down
	compiled code by some 10% and it needs some additional memory.
	OTOH, it also provides additional data that will be needed in the
	planned symbolic debugger, and it seems to be the most efficient
	way to handle dangling expression pointers after an exception
	anyway.

2008-05-17  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.cc (pure_free_internal): Fixed a glitch which was
	causing big memleaks. Reported by Libor Spacek.

	* interpreter.cc (define): Fixed error messages.
	
	* interpreter.cc, runtime.h: Reorganize pure_expr data structure
	so that the data fields are *always* aligned on 8 byte boundaries.
	This should now also work on 32 bit architectures where doubles
	are aligned on 8 byte boundaries, such as Linux on 32 bit PPC.
	Reported by Tim Haynes.

	* interpreter.cc: Fixed some case labels in switch instructions
	which should be signed rather than unsigned values. Also made
	void* a pointer to a dummy struct in LLVM IR, so that it can be
	distinguished from all other pointer types, and added support for
	short (16 bit) and long (64 bit) integer types (as well as the
	corresponding pointer types) in the C interface.

	Please note that the typename 'long' *always* denotes signed 64
	bit integers in Pure's extern declarations, even if the C 'long'
	type is actually 32 bit (as it usually is even on most 64 bit
	systems).

2008-05-16  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* runtime.h: Fix compilation problems when header gets included
	from C.

2008-05-14  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* funcall.h: Reduce maximum number of function parameters to
	64. This seems to be large enough for most purposes, and speeds up
	compilation with -Ox by a factor of around 10.

	* Makefile: Overhaul of build options. In particular, the
	'default' build now includes basic optimization (-O) which makes
	the interpreter almost as fast as with the 'release' build, and
	produces a working interpreter also on 64 bit systems. (The
	'debug' build is still broken there, but see the SYSTEM NOTES
	section in the INSTALL file for a workaround.)

	* interpreter.cc, runtime.cc: 64 bit compatibility fixes in bigint
	handling.

2008-05-12  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Fix a severe bug in the environment handling
	code of the code generator, which could cause failed assertions in
	the code generator, or wrong code to be generated in some cases.
	To resolve this issue, the code generator now properly keeps
	separate environments for each rule of a function
	definition. Reported by John Lunney.

	* Makefile: Redirect warning and error messages from regression
	tests to the logfile.

2008-05-10  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc (uminop): Handle the value -0x80000000 at the
	border of the int range, so that it is correctly treated as a
	machine int.

2008-05-09  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lexer.ll, printer.cc, etc.: Change the "G" suffix to denote
	bigints to "L" ("G" can too easily be mistaken for a digit; also,
	Python uses the same "L" notation for bigints). Reported by Eddie
	Rucker.

2008-05-06  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/primitives.pure: Made the pow function work with all
	combinations of integer and double arguments. Also added the sqrt
	function and the ^ operator.

	* runtime.cc, lib/primitives.pure: Added predicates funp, lambdap,
	varp checking for named and anonymous closures and unbound global
	variables, respectively. Requested by Libor Spacek.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern, fun_prolog): Handle some obscure
	cases of name collisions between Pure and C functions.

2008-05-05  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* INSTALL: Add system-specific notes.

	* Makefile: Massaged some rules for OSX compatibility. In
	particular, -rdynamic is now in the LDFLAGS, so that it can be
	removed more easily, and I also removed the install -s flag so
	that the pure executable is installed without stripping the
	symbols which are needed to properly resolve runtime externals on
	OSX. Reported by Ryan Schmidt and others.

	* matcher.cc (merge_ctrans): Fixed broken mpz_cmp() test causing
	transitions on different (instead of equal) bigint constants to be
	merged. Reported by Libor Spacek.

2008-05-04  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.2 release.

	* lexer.ll, printer.cc: Add an explicit notation for big
	integers. Any integer immediately followed by the uppercase letter
	"G" (as in "biG" or "GMP") will now always be interpreted as a
	bigint constant, even if it fits into a machine integer. This
	notation is also used when printing bigint constants. This change
	was necessary to make it possible to write rules matching against
	"small bigint" constants.

	* lib/primitives.pure: Added operations to recognize function
	applications and extract the function and argument parts,
	implemented in runtime.cc. Note that these operations can't be
	defined in Pure because of the "head is function" rule which means
	that in a pattern of the form f x, f is always a literal function
	symbol and not a variable.

2008-05-03  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* README: Moved installation instructions to a separate INSTALL
	file, added Eddie Rucker's detailed instructions there.

	* util.cc (myiconv): Apple's iconv takes const char** as 2nd
	parameter. #ifdef that case. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* interpreter.cc (declare_extern): Fixed a bug in the generated
	wrapper code for external calls, which caused function arguments
	to be garbage-collected prematurely, when they were still needed
	to create the default value, in the case of external calls
	returning a null expression pointer to indicate failure. Reported
	by Eddie Rucker.

	* test/test4.pure: Disabled tail call checks, as they may fail on
	some platforms. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* test/test1.pure: Corrected fact3 example, added test cases.
	Reported by Libor Spacek.

2008-05-02  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Makefile: Overhaul of regression tests so that results of
	expressions are recorded. Also, 'make check' doesn't depend on the
	log files any more, so that the logs can be stored in svn. You can
	now use the explicit goal 'make logs' to regenerate the logs for
	changed test files.

	* runtime.cc (same): Added a syntactic equality test. Requested by
	Eddie Rucker.

	* Makefile: Add $(LDFLAGS) and $(LIBS) to the link line, so that
	the user can easily add his own linker options and local
	libraries.

	* lib/strings.pure: Add missing range check in string indexing
	operation. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

	* printer.cc (operator <<): Handle stack overflow while printing
	an expression.

	* interpreter.cc (dodefn): Fix a tricky bug causing the executable
	code of closures bound to variables to be freed when it was still
	needed. Reported by Chris Double.

2008-05-01  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Proper alignment of value fields in expression
	struct on 64 bit systems. Reported by Tim Haynes.

	* Makefile: g++ shouldn't be hardcoded, use $(CXX) instead.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* runtime.cc (pure_sys_vars): More OSX compatibility fixes.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

2008-04-30  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* interpreter.cc: Fix a compilation error (STL bug:
	http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11729) as well as some
	bogus warnings with Apple gcc 4.0.1. Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* Makefile (make depend): Get rid of bogus LLVM dependencies.
	Reported by Ryan Schmidt.

	* lexer.ll, parser.yy: Fixes for compatibility with newer flex and
	bison versions. Reported by Eddie Rucker.

2008-04-29  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* 0.1 release.

2008-04-28  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* examples/symbolic.pure: Add symbolic evaluation example. This is
	just a straightforward port of some Q examples.

	* runtime.cc: Add support for advisory stack checks.

	* matcher.cc: Bugfixes.

2008-04-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* lib/string.pure: Added split and join functions.

	* pure.1, examples/hello.pure: Overhaul n queens example, added
	quicksort and binary search tree examples.

	* lib/prelude.pure: Added void and curry/uncurry combinators, do,
	zipdo.

	* interpreter.cc, pure.cc, runtime.cc: Make SIGINT generate a
	useful exception value.

	* pure.cc: Add completion for global function and variable
	symbols.

2008-04-22  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* Got a working interpreter, at last. There's still lots of stuff
	to do (see the TODO file), but the interpreter should now be
	usable as it is.

2008-03-27  Albert Graef  <Dr.Graef@t-online.de>

	* ChangeLog started
